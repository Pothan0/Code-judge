### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd auth-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Seed the database with sample problems:
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd auth-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage Guide

### For Students/Programmers

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or login to existing account
2. **Browse Problems**: Navigate to the problems page to see available challenges
3. **Filter Problems**: Use difficulty and tag filters to find suitable problems
4. **Solve Problems**: Click on a problem to view details and start coding
5. **Choose Language**: Select your preferred programming language (C++/Java/Python)
6. **Write Code**: Use the Monaco editor to write your solution
7. **Test Code**: Use custom input to test your code before submission
8. **Submit Solution**: Submit your code for evaluation
9. **View Results**: Check your submission status and results

## Default Admin Account

After running the seed script, you can login as admin using:
- **Email**: admin@onlinejudge.com
- **Password**: admin123

## Code Execution Security

The platform implements several security measures:

1. **Process Isolation**: Each code execution runs in a separate process
2. **Time Limits**: Configurable execution time limits to prevent infinite loops
3. **Memory Limits**: Memory usage restrictions (future enhancement)
4. **Temporary Files**: Automatic cleanup of temporary compilation files
5. **Input Sanitization**: Proper validation of user inputs

## Sample Problems

The platform comes with 5 pre-configured problems:

1. **Two Sum** (Easy) - Hash table problem
2. **Reverse Integer** (Medium) - Math problem
3. **Valid Parentheses** (Easy) - Stack problem
4. **Longest Common Subsequence** (Hard) - Dynamic programming
5. **Fibonacci Number** (Easy) - Math/DP/Recursion
